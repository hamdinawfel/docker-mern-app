## 1. Host Volumes and Nodemo <a name="heading--1"/>

See set-nodemon branch

### Motivation

> One of the irritating things about testing during development with Docker and ExpressJS is that whenever you change your code, you have to wait for the container to rebuild

### Remediation

> Host volumes sync file changes between a local host folder and a container folder.

> Nodemon is a Node.js package that automatically restarts an application when it detects file changes in one or more specified directories.

> By using a host volume and nodemon, the Node.js applicationâ€™s container automatically syncs code changes between the container and the local folder.
